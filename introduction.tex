\section{Internet of Things(IoT)}
The Internet of Things is a complete form of IoT. It is used to connect, control and manage systems connected to the Internet. The Internet is a network of devices of all shapes and sizes, not just a computer network. These are toys, cameras, home appliances, etc. It can allow things to be connected to anything using any path or service.\\
IoT consists of four architectural layers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Things
    \item Gateway
    \item Internet
    \item Services
\end{itemize}

\section{IoT-Based Smart Bin}
A smart bin is a trash can for collecting waste. It can detect waste level using an ultrasonic sensor. Whenever the level crosses the threshold i.e. 80 \%, it is connected to the IoT based controller. The control unit is connected to a valve that connects the bottom of the basket and the outlet to the suction pump. This suction pump sucks waste from the bin until the bin is empty. When the bin is completely empty, the waste is thrown into the incinerator. The waste is therefore automatically decomposed.
\par No one uses the bin because of the dirty surroundings of the bin and reluctance to touch the lid of the bin. So this project develops automatic door opening using ultrasonic sensor and servo motor.
\section{Waste Classification using Machine Learning}
\par Waste can be separated between plastic and non-plastic via smart bins. Three machine learning models are utilised in this instance to classify the garbage.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
    \item Random Forest
    \item Gaussian Naive Bayes
\end{itemize}
\par By determining the values for precision, accuracy, recall, and f1-score, the three models are assessed. Therefore, locating the ideal waste classification model is simple.
