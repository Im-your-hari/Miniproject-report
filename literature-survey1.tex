\hspace{.2cm}  RFID Based attendance system
: In this paper RFID Based attendance system has been developed where, RFID tranceiver that communicates with a passive tag when the tag enters the generated RF field it is able to draw enough power from the field to access its internal memory and transmit its stored information. When the transponder tag draws power in its way the resultant interaction of the RF fields causes the voltage at the tranciever anteena to drop in value. Their effect is utilized by the tag to communicates its information to the reader\\

\hspace{.2cm} Video streaming to random cloud using Raspberry Pi and FFMPEG based USB Camera : Rapid technological growth made surveillance as most promising application domain. With great extent of smart city most of the things are controlled by internet. Security is one of the applications that everyone needs to be controlled remotely. This paper presents cloud based surveillance system for live video streaming that can be surveillance from anywhere and anytime. This system provides the live streaming by using cloud; Raspberry Pi 2 module and FFMPEG based USB Camera.

CoAP based IoT data transfer from a Raspberry Pi to Cloud : Things board is an  open source software tool, which is used to collect, monitor and visualise streams of data received in real-time by sensor devices. The platform can be hosted in the cloud and provides Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocols support.  A CoAP-based IoT architecture is proposed using a Raspberry Pi (RPi) and sensors acting as IoT endpoints and it will poll sensors and using CoAP send the latest data formatted as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to the ThingsBoard cloud endpoint at regular intervals.
