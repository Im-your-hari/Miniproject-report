\par The findings demonstrate that the Random Forest Classifier can accurately, precisely, recall, and F1 score categorise garbage photos into plastic and non-plastic categories. Despite not reaching the same level of parameters, the other two models exhibit respectably strong accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC. Successful development of a smart bin prototype that can automate decomposition and manage lid movement has been made.
\par In the future, a human detection sensor could be used in place of an ultrasonic sensor to identify people.
