RFID Based Surveillance system is a best way to keep our children safe in school bus. As technology is growing rapidly we are also
moving to a technical world where safety can be provided technologically. The main goal is to ensure that the children board the school bus correctly and that they have no other issues on the bus. On the bus,
The video of the student is delivered through an app installed on the parent's phone so that the parents can monitor their children live and ensure their safety. When a student gets on a bus from their bus stop and scans the RFID on his ID card, parents can see them through the app installed on their phone. It ends when the student arrives at the correct location and scans the RFID again. Such a system will help student to travel safe.
