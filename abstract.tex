The major objective of this project is to create intelligent garbage that can gauge the amount of waste present and transition automatically to an incinerator for decomposition. Additionally, it has the ability to recognise an approaching object and open the bin's lid automatically. A software component of this study uses three machine learning algorithms to classify waste into plastic and non-plastic waste. They are the Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and CNN models. Then determine the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score values to assess the performance of these three machine learning models. When the performance of the three algorithms is compared, Random Forest performs best.
